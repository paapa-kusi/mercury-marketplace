### Challenge Statement Solution
Mercury Marketplace is an online shopping solution for students to quickly and easily list their old school supplies for purchase by other students. Products found on the marketplace include common supplies such as notebooks, binders, calculators, etc. However, where Mercury distinguishes itself is its ability to interface with partnered universities to provide access to materials that may be unique to specific courses and difficult to procure otherwise (idk how u guys feel about this). For instance, many computer engineering courses may require a FPGA board for hands-on exercises. In many cases, students would have to pay steep retail prices for this item. Mercury Marketplace enables more affordable pricing by allowing students who have completed a course to sell their old supplies. This effectively keeps school supplies in circulation for the duration of their useful life and improves students' financial wellbeing.

### Project Vision
For students who are in need of affordable and fairly priced school supplies. Mercury Marketplace is an online student-to-student commerce platform that connects students requiring niche and expensive materials with students that have a lightly-used and unneeded supply. Unlike other shopping services like Amazon and eBay, our product is intimately connected to the unique situation of college students, using university and course-specific information for product tailoring when possible.
